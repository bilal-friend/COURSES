    <h1 class="title">Week 1</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>the computer understand only binary that are 0 and 1</li>
      <li>
        the computer Has Transistor .sometimes drive the electricity and
        sometimes don't , when it do so the value equal 1 , and when don't the
        value equal 0
      </li>
      <li>
        transistor is a unity sometimes 1 and sometimes 0 , this unity called
        bit , and byte express 8 bit so 8 transistor

      </li>
      <hr />
      <li>
        the computer understand 0 and 1 , but how it understands
        languages,imgages, videos and musics
        <ul>
          <li>
            Languages: some scientits decided to create a systme name ASCII CODE
            that convert evry character or number or letter to value by binary
            but this system isn't enought because we have just 255 things that
            we can exprees and we have more than this like arabic character and
            china and some emojes ... , and this is why they create another
            system name Unicode that give us from 16 bit to 32 bit
          </li>
          <li>
            Colors and Images : RGB is a color Systm Contain 3Byte 1Byte for red
            and 1Byte for green and 1byte blue and if we play with quantities of
            these colors we can get all the colors millon of colors , and sure
            evry byte contain 8bit . And Computer Understand images and for be
            Honest an images is a big amount of pixels and evry pixel is a color
            with RGB System
          </li>
          <li>
            Videos : For be honset here also , the video is images that change
            fast , by example a video with 30fps mean that in 1s we see 30 image
            change
          </li>
          <li>Music : evry note has it's one code by a system</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Alogorithm: is steps to slove the problem and steps to realize your tast
      </li>
      <li>Scrach : see the project for understand</li>
    </ul>
