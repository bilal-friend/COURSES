for speak with computers we have to learn a programing language that is crafting by english
language and the computer doesn't know our language , so here we need a compiler that know english and
binary ==> COMPILER
--------------------------
For make a C FILE the file must be with .C extension
---------------------------------------SYNTAX----------------------------------------------------------
  int main(void){            | that is equal "when green flak clicked " in scrath
            commands         |
  }                          |

in {} you write commands but you have to declare where libary you get the commands , so syntax become

 #include <stdio.h>
 int main(void){
    printf("Hello,world");
 }
 The question is "how can I start my programme"
 Answear : you have to transform the file to a file the conputer understand , so in terminal write
  $ make file-name (without extension)
  $ ./file-name (also whitout ext)
  in the file that you create there is binary code

Function PRINTF("write what you want") ; for return to new line "\n"; 'back slash n"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- DATA-Types---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             1. bool (true,false) ==> 1 byte
             2. int (integer)   ==> 4 byte
             3. long   ==> 8 byte
             4. float  ==> 4 byte
             5. double ==> 8 byte
             6. char   ==> 1 byte
             7. string ==> ? byte (we dont know , it depends ! )(it's not a type of date )
